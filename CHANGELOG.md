# @vex/ui

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d2882b: VxAccountMenu's sign-out item now reads "Sign out" (it still ends every session), and a new `checking` prop greys out Sign in with the tooltip "Checking sign-in…". VxAccount sets it until the account check finishes.

### Patch Changes

- 4f3bd32: Softer window reflections on glass panels: the bands drop from 5% to 3%. The strength is now one token, `--vx-glass-streak`.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e3a933: Add `VxToc` (an "On this page" table of contents with scroll-spy), and make headings stand out from body text: accent-tinted `.vx-display` gradient, rule above page sections, accent sub-headings.
- 09ea34d: Glass, picked in the lab's /design/glass: no backdrop blur anywhere (panels, buttons, inputs, code), a thinner tint, a lit rim on `.vx-panel`, and seeded window reflections pinned to the screen that drift at half the scroll speed (VxSiteShell sets `--vx-scroll-y`). New tokens `--vx-glass-rim` and `--vx-glass-reflect`.

### Patch Changes

- ddb475e: VxStarfield: star positions no longer depend on the page height. The sky is built from fixed tiles seeded by their page-absolute position, and pointer parallax is measured against a fixed 900px, so content loading, collapsing or resizing no longer makes the stars jump.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- c3a715a: The package is now `@vex/ui`, installed from `github:vexouLuna/vex-ui`, and it uses `@vex/platform-web` 0.9.0. Sites
  change their imports from `@vexoulz/ui` (and `/account`, `/utils`, the CSS entries) to `@vex/ui` when they bump, together
  with `@vex/platform-web`. Sign-in now sends its CSRF token as `X-Vex-CSRF` (`CSRF_HEADER`); vex-auth accepts both names.
  The site list's `repo` fields and the footer's issue and commit links point at the renamed `vexouLuna/*` repos, and the
  footer credit reads "made by vexouLuna".

## 0.24.1

### Patch Changes

- f6d2a77: `platform.css` gives platform-web's chat user card the popup fill with a frosted blur, so it reads clearly over chat
  instead of showing the lines behind it.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 985d531: Windows (`.vx-panel`) and platform-web panels (`platform.css`) are clear glass: no blur, a thin tint, a sheen and a lit top edge (new tokens `--vx-glass-clear`, `--vx-glass-sheen`, `--vx-glass-edge`), so the stars stay sharp behind them. Code blocks (`.vx-code`) are frosted glass like the buttons. Platform-web dialogs keep the near-opaque popup fill.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 41f641d: `@vexoulz/ui/platform.css`: @vexoulz/platform-web's `--vxp-*` variables mapped onto the Deep Field tokens, on plain
  `:root` (platform-web v0.5.0+ keeps its defaults under `:where(:root)`). Replaces the copies in doomtp-web and
  vods-core, and gives platform-web's accent the site's colour inside a site shell (`[data-site]`) instead of the
  neutral one.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ffde6c: Hatch tokens for the diagonal-stripe patterns: `--vx-hatch` (light stripes), `--vx-hatch-dark` (dark stripes over a colour), `--vx-hatch-bad` (error stripes) and `--vx-hatch-faint` (the placeholder fill). The placeholder and the restricted chapter in `.vx-chapterbar` now use them; the restricted stripe is `--vx-ink` instead of pure white (#f2f2f2 vs #fff at 35%).

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 08fa15a: `createAccount()` defaults to the production vexoulz-auth and reads the site's `VITE_AUTH_BASE` itself; new `<VxAccount>` (VxAccountMenu wired to `useAccount()`); the tab-return listener is removed when the app unmounts or on `account.dispose()`.
- a3c1e5b: `VxInput` takes `width`, `grow` and `maxWidth`, and `VxPlaceholder` takes `flush` (no border or corners, fills its box), so sites stop sizing them through `:deep()` on private classes.
- 8600dcd: `useResource`, `usePoll` and `useNow` in `@vexoulz/ui/utils` (and the main entry): loads that abort and outrun stale ones and keep the last good data, polling that pauses on a hidden tab, and a shared ticking clock.
- 660a11c: New `@vexoulz/ui/utils` subpath: `clamp`, `place`, the game and Twitch colours, `learnGameColors`, `useDismiss` and the `useToast()` store, with no component or style attached.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- d5ba1c1: `VxStarfield` stops its animation frame loop while scrolled out of view instead of waking up every frame to skip
  drawing, and picks it up again when it comes back.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- de9eaab: Real brand art: `VxMark` (the vexoul.net mark, currentColor) is now the site switcher's default mark, coloured with the site accent, and `VxNoThumbnail` is the 16:9 stand-in for streams and VODs without a thumbnail. `VxTwitchGlyph` (Twitch's glyph, currentColor) replaces the account menu's sign-in placeholder.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 8766500: `keekivods` is an outside link now, like the shop (`external: true`, no `repo`): it has its own look and isn't built on this library, so it is no longer a `SiteId`. It keeps its accent for the link and stays `hidden` until the site is live.
- 386b18a: `keekivods` is no longer `hidden`: keekivods.vexoul.net is live, so it shows in the site switcher.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ca4f63: `keekivods` (keekivods.vexoul.net, keeki_dechu's VOD archive) joins `SITES` with its own accent, `--vx-accent-keekivods`. It is `hidden` (left out of the switchers) until the site is live.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 2fa2d41: The site name reads as the new hostname: `vexoul.net`, `vods.vexoul.net`. `VxLockup` writes "vexoul" and shows ".net" by default (header and footer included; `:net="false"` drops it), and the switcher's labels name vexoul.net.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- eab3273: The shop moves to `shop.vexoul.net`: its `SITES` host and link now use it.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- a3af956: The shop gets an accent, salmon (`#cb8c7c`), so its link and switcher dot can be coloured like the other sites'. New type `AccentSiteId` names every entry with an accent; `SiteId` still names only the sites built on this library.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 06f5ef9: The sites move to `vexoul.net`: `SITES` hosts and links, the account menu note and the starfield's default seed now
  use it. The shop keeps its own domain.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e3b73c: `NavItem` takes `external`: the header nav opens that link in a new tab and marks it with ↗, like the site switcher
  does for sites off the network.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 4260085: VxTooltip's bubble takes the overlay base (`vx-overlay`) like the other overlays moved into `<body>`, so it's in
  the site's font and color instead of the browser default.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 366f65d: VxSegmented: disabled options now look disabled (faded, struck through, not-allowed cursor), and options take a
  `title` tooltip, e.g. to say why one is off.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b3190c: `VxSiteSwitcher`: other sites open in a new tab (the current site still opens in place).

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- d845641: `VxTabs`: when the tabs don't fit, the side with more fades out under an arrow button that scrolls the row, and the
  chosen tab is kept in view. The component's root is now a `.vx-tabs-wrap` around the `.vx-tabs` tablist.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c8d410: VxPopover (and so VxSelect, VxAccountMenu and VxSiteSwitcher) teleports its panel to `<body>` and places it from
  its trigger, so a dialog, a table's scroller or a sideways-scrolling bar no longer cuts it off. It follows the trigger
  while the page scrolls and sits above dialogs. A percentage `width` is now of the trigger's width, and on VxSelect it makes the select fill its container. VxTooltip's bubble is teleported the same way, so a table's scroller no longer hides it. `useDismiss`
  takes several elements. New `.vx-form-row`: a row of fields and buttons that stays lined up with the fields'
  controls when a field shows help or error text underneath.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bc41aa0: `@vexoulz/ui/account`: the shared *.vexoulz.net sign-in from a site's side. `createAccount({ authBase })` (installed
  with `app.use`) and `useAccount()` give the signed-in user from vexoulz-auth, `signIn()`, `signOut({ everywhere })`,
  and `request()` for credentialed calls with the CSRF header. Without `authBase` the account is disabled.
  `VxAccountMenu`'s disabled title now says sign-in isn't available here, not "coming soon".

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- af00cc4: dtp.vexoulz.net and status.vexoulz.net are live: both are listed in the site switchers.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1aff2f6: For status.vexoulz.net:
  
  - `status` in `SITES` (lavender accent, hidden until the site is live, repo `vexouLuna/vex-status`).
  - `VxStatusDot` takes `status="down"`: plain red, where `live` is red with a halo. Its statuses other than `live`
    are the new `Health` type (`ok | warn | down | off`).
  - `VxUptimeBar`: a row of ticks, one per check, hour or day, coloured by `Health`, with each tick's label shown on
    hover or focus. `slots` pads it to a fixed length so stacked bars line up; `selectable` with
    `v-model:selected` makes the ticks buttons (arrow keys move between them) so a page can show the chosen one in
    full.

### Patch Changes

- 182e80c: `VxTooltip` keeps its bubble on screen: near a side of the screen it slides sideways, and with no room above it
  opens below.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- c3e6bce: vods' accent is a brighter mint green (`#51ffa8`, was `#74e39a`).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ada1cec: Fixes that sites used to patch around, and less work at runtime:
  
  - `VxInput` passes attributes and listeners (`aria-*`, `min`, `@blur`, …) to its `<input>`; `class`/`style` stay on
    the wrapper.
  - `VxSiteShell` takes `header` (off for theater-style views), and a page's own shell now fills the window
    (`min-height: 100dvh`, `100dvh` when `fill`) on the site background, with `html`/`body` margins reset. Sites can
    drop their copies of those rules.
  - `VxButton` takes `block` (full width).
  - `VxPopover` focuses its panel's `[autofocus]` element on open, stays above later siblings while open, and only
    listens on the document while open (`useDismiss` attaches its listeners only while active).
  - New `timeAgo(isoOrMs)` time helper.
  - No more `!important` in the header and chapter bar styles; removed the unused `.vx-btn-group`, `.vx-breadcrumbs`
    and `.vx-avatar-initials` classes and the `.vx-panel.is-pop` selector.
  - `twitchColor` caches readable colours; learned box-art hues are applied once per frame instead of once per image.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- a745251: Footer: the year is back in the credit ("made by vEXOULZ with 🧻 · 2026"); both emoji are drawn at text size and
  every item shares one line height, so the words line up; the switcher's label lines up with the build below it on
  phones.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5bd5d19: Emoji render as Twemoji on every site: `fonts.css` adds a self-hosted Twemoji face ("Vx Twemoji") after Geist in
  both font stacks. It only covers characters that are emoji by default, so text symbols (arrows, ▶, ⚙) keep the
  text font, and the full set (~430 KB) loads only on pages that show other emoji than the footer's.
  
  Footer: the build sits next to the site switcher, then "🛑 report an issue" and the credit, now "made by vEXOULZ
  with 🧻", on the right. On phones: switcher | report, then build | credit.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 5390581: Footer: "report an issue" gets a red ❗ (Twemoji) and sits on the switcher's row on phones, with the credit and build
  on their own row below.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e7aebd: The footer shows which build of the site is running (the commit, linked to it on GitHub, plus a release version
  when there is one) and a "report an issue" link to the site's GitHub issues. Sites pass their build with
  `app.use(VxBuild, { commit })`; `SITES` entries gain `repo`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a716ccd: One list of sites, `SITES` in `src/sites.ts`: each entry has its host, switcher line, link and accent colour, and
  `hidden` leaves a site that isn't live yet out of the switchers (dtp, for now). The accent CSS is generated from it,
  so a new site is one entry. `--vx-info` replaces `--vx-accent-root` where the pale blue meant "info" (info callouts,
  placeholders in code); `--vx-accent-<id>` and `.vx-accent-<id>` still exist, now generated. `SiteInfo.id` is a
  plain string; `NetworkSiteId` is the id of any entry.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- de75a58: vods' accent is green (`#74e39a`) instead of orange. It's brighter and more saturated than `--vx-ok`, so an ok status
  still reads apart from the accent.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bd60aae: The header brand (`VxSiteSwitcher brand`) links to the site's home page from every other page, so there's always a
  way back. Its caret is a separate button that still opens the site menu. On the home page, the whole brand opens the
  menu as before. The new `home` prop (default `/`) says where home is.

### Patch Changes

- 6201a58: Bare `code`, `kbd`, `samp` and `pre` inside a site use `--vx-font-mono` instead of the browser's default monospace,
  so they match the rest of the site (and a site's own font stack, like dtp's Twemoji sign, reaches them too).
- f4b3bc1: `.vx-table` rows hug their text (7px above and below) instead of always being 44px tall, so a table of one-line
  rows no longer floats its words in empty space. A table with controls in its cells (buttons, inputs, switches,
  steppers, segmented controls) keeps 44px rows, so rows with and without a button still line up.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- d03a930: Game colours can come from box art: `learnGameColors()` samples each game's art once and `gameColor()` then uses
  its dominant hue (same muted saturation and lightness as before, so every game stays in one pastel family and
  readable on black). Games without art, or with grey art, keep the name-based hue. Also exports `dominantHue`,
  `setGameHue`, `hasGameHue` and `sampleHue`.
- 86e30a4: Posters get a solid colour band along the bottom (`PosterGame.color`, or the game's colour). `gamePalette(names)`
  gives neighbouring games with similar hues different shades so they stay apart; `VxChapterBar` takes it as `palette`.
- 1eaf4d9: `VxPosters` keeps its z-order to itself (`isolation: isolate`), so posters in a scrolling menu no longer paint over a
  sticky header above them.
- b00b9f5: `VxInput type="search"` no longer shows the browser's own clear button next to the `clearable` one.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 7f58ae1: VxPopover slides sideways to stay on screen when its alignment would push it past the viewport edge (narrow
  phones). New `clampX` helper in the placement utils.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8614834: First release of the Deep Field library: tokens, base styles, site chrome (shell, header, footer, site switcher,
  account menu), controls, overlays, feedback, data and media components, and Histoire stories.
